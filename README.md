# Product-Demand-Forecasting-AI-for-Economics
Hi everyone!

In this Project for the subject AI for Economics, we have made an application interface that can help us forecast :

Total units that can be demanded at various stores
Total SKUs that can be demanded
both are predicted on a weekly basis

We tried Multiple models like :

Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XGBOOST Regressor
LSTM
Among all the models, Random Forest Regressor performed the best.
